# Junkpotoo

A framework for creating realtime services (mostly focused at IoT), with the
following features:

- Services offer type-safe contracts (SOAP-like)
- Channels as a first-class type (Go-like)
- Network transparency

Written in elixir.

Yet another work in progress project... may or may not be usable some time in
the future.
